this is cannon's algorithm for matrix-matrix multiplication

make sure the matrix is square, also boundary condition is not considered in this implementation
it will be considered in the later released version

matrix_gen is used to generate random matrix, ex: ./matrix_gen -n 50 -r 10 to generate 50 by 50 
matrix with the number range between 0 to 10
